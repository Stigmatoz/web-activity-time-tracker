Web Activity Time Tracker keeps track of how much time you spend on the web and presents the stats in a useful and intuitive way. 
You can set a daily visit limit for sites and block it after the expiration of the limit. 

Extension uses only local [chrome.storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage) chrome.storage API to store data and it does't send data anywhere.
